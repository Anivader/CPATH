# CPATH  
This repository contains computational pipelines to perform Deep Learning-based classification on Whole Slide Images (WSIs).  

## **Details**  
Currently, this codebase is structured as follows -  
[1] _**CPATH**_ - Deep Learning workflows for WSI classification/feature extraction using "supervised" as well as "self-supervised" learning.  
[2] _**Czi_processing**_ - Working with WSIs in "_.czi_" format.  
[3] _**HnE_normalization**_ - Stain normalization protocol.  
[4] _**Testing_other_repos**_ - Adapting latest SOTA such as HIPT (https://github.com/mahmoodlab/HIPT) and SAM (https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything).  

## _**Stay tuned for exciting future updates!!**_
